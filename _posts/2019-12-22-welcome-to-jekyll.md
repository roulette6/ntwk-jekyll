When I study something I need to remember, I am compelled to take notes. I therefore ended up with extensive notes while preparing for the Cisco CCNA RS and CCNP RS exams.

I take notes in MS OneNote, but I find that finding information takes longer than I'd like because I have several notebooks and sections, many of which have repeated references to the search terms. I therefore made this website to help me more quickly find some of the information I return to repeatedly. I hope it can be useful to others who also need a cheat sheet or sorts and to those who are studying to (re)certify.

This website is not meant to replace wonderful, usually paid, resources like networklessons.com, but let me know if certain sections could benefit from some clarification.

The main menu is organized with switching before routing because layer 2 precedes layer 3, so I recommend you read in that order if you're not coming to find a specific topic.
