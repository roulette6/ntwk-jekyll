# Hello, world!

This website is the result of the notes I took on my quest to get the Cisco CCNA RS and CCNP RS certifications. Since these notes leave out information I was certain I'd remember, they are not meant to replace all the wonderful, usually paid, resources that are geared towards raw beginners.

Beginners should start with the Basics section, followed by Switching, then Routing. I hope you find this site helpful.
